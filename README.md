### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with a strong focus on **fintech**, **secure payments**, and **real-world business applications**.

By day, I work at **Global Payments Inc.**, one of the world's largest payment tech companies — helping build, scale, and refine critical systems that process billions in transactions.

Previously, I was at **Meta (Facebook VR Labs)**, where I helped ensure the quality of next-gen immersive tech. That attention to detail and focus on performance still shapes everything I build today.
