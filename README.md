# 👋 Hi, I'm Radoslav — Full-Stack Developer & Payment Tech Specialist

🚀 **Web & Software Developer | Ex-Meta (VR Labs) | Laravel, .NET, JavaScript | Global Payments Inc.**

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a full-stack developer with a strong focus on **fintech**, **secure payments**, and **real-world web applications**. By day, I work as a **Product Advocate** at **Global Payments Inc.**, one of the largest payment tech companies in the world — building, scaling, and improving mission-critical systems used by millions of merchants globally.

Before that, I worked at **Meta (Facebook VR Labs)**, where I helped test and refine next-gen immersive tech. That precision and engineering discipline still shape the way I build software today.
